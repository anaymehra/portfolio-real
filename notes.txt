We are gonna be using 
Three.js a powerful 3d graphics library,
React Three Fiber,
Tailwind CSS,
Framer Motion for animation in React.
Email.js

The 3d models are in gltf format download them using any free website
We copied an entire css file (basically gradients, fonts, colors), 3d model, assets folder, and a plain components folder
A style.js file that states some useful tailwind utility styles. (specifying our own variables that have their own tailwind classes)
An updated tailwind.css config file, specifying our own tailwind classes.
A motion.js file inside utils folder,containing framer motion animations.
An index.js inside constants folder, containing all of the content, services, testimonials, etc inside one file that wwe can change or update later on. 

Basically I destructured every piece of content
